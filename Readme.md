# Customer Service Enhancement with Generative AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize customer service by using generative AI to deliver personalized, efficient, and proactive support. Our goal is to automate real-time responses to customer inquiries, offer tailored recommendations based on customer data, integrate smoothly with existing service platforms, and ensure top-notch security and data privacy.

## Features

- **Automated Real-Time Responses:** Uses generative AI to provide immediate, accurate responses to customer queries.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Tailors recommendations based on customer data and interactions.
- **Integration with Existing Platforms:** Seamlessly integrates with current customer service platforms.
- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** Adheres to the highest standards of data security and privacy.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

- `rag.py`: Handles the processing of PDF documents, creation of vector databases, and setup of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain.
- `bank_crm.py`: Manages customer relationship management (CRM) tasks including user information and file management.
- `bank_statement.py`: Provides functionality for analyzing bank statements and generating insights.
- `utils/setup.py`: Contains utility functions for setting up directories and configurations.
- `utils/user_authentication.py`: Manages user authentication and account creation.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application, handling user interactions, authentication, and session management.
